Set theoretical file comparison and manipulation

I frequently want to do set theory things with the lines in a
file. For example, I might have a set of files each containing a list
of installed packages on a machine, and I want to know things: 1) what
packages are installed on all systems (set intersection), 2) what is
the list of all installed packages (set union), 3) what packages are
only installed on machine A (set difference), 4) etcâ€¦ These tools
facilitate such computations (see the script documentation for more
examples).

 - =lineSetOp.rb= ::
   A ruby script that can do many different kinds of set theory
   computations. Each "set" is defined by a file with the set
   elements being each line of the file. 
 - =lineMapDiff.rb= ::
   A ruby script similar to =lineSetOp.rb= but it operates on maps
   (ordered pairs) instead of sets, and only preforms a kind of set
   difference.
 - =uniq.rb= :: 
   A "stable" version of the UNIX command =uniq= that doesn't require
   a file to be sorted to work.  It spits out the first occurrence of
   each line.
